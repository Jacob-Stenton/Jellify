# Jellify
A music player for Jellyfin powered by React Native. Designed to be lightweight, fast, and support ***extremely*** large music libraries (i.e., > 100K songs)

While other music players provide a WYSIWYG music player experience, *Jellify* caters to those who want a music player experience similar to what's provided by music streaming services. *Jellify* provides:

- Quick access to previously played and favorite tracks
- An infinitly<sup>TM</sup> customizable home screen
    - Select from the provided quick filters or build a custom filter
- Support for Jellyfin mixes
- Quick access to similar artists and items for discovering music in your library
